/**
 * Sleuth 1.x optimized for log-correlation only. Unless "spring-cloud-sleuth-zipkin" was
 * present, the sampler defaulted to {@link Sampler#NEVER_SAMPLE}. This was to ensure the
 * log only nodes never set the sampled flag.
 *
 * <p>
 * "spring-cloud-sleuth-zipkin" obviated the {@link Sampler#NEVER_SAMPLE} default by
 * importing {@link SamplerAutoConfiguration}. Nothing else did, so sampling properties
 * were effectively ignored unless "spring-cloud-sleuth-zipkin" was in use, or something
 * else similarly imported {@link SamplerAutoConfiguration}.
 *
 * <p>
 * During a review of Wavefront integration, it was considered not correct to have other
 * code import {@link SamplerAutoConfiguration}. To avoid that, retain the old behaviour
 * about log only nodes, and also not pin configuration to Zipkin involves a more complex
 * condition.
 *
 * <p>
 * This condition looks for signs of non-default setup which likely requires sampling
 * configuration. It passes on one of the following beans exist:
 *
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@code zipkin2.reporter.Reporter} - what's used by Zipkin or others like
 * Stackdriver</li>
 * <li>{@link SpanHandler} - only accepts sampled data</li>
 * <li>{@link TracingCustomizer} - can configure one of the above</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * An integrated test that shows {@link Sampler#NEVER_SAMPLE} is default on fail exists in
 * {@code TraceAutoConfigurationTests} intentionally, as users now needn't import
 * {@link SamplerAutoConfiguration} directly.
