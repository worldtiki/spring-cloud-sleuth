Spring Cloud Sleuth provides Spring Boot auto-configuration for distributed
tracing.

## Features

Sleuth configures everything you need to get started. This includes where trace
data (spans) are reported to, how many traces to keep (sampling), if remote
fields (baggage) are sent, and which libraries are traced.

Specifically, Spring Cloud Sleuth...

* Adds trace and span ids to the Slf4J MDC, so you can extract all the logs from a given trace or span in a log aggregator.
* Instruments common ingress and egress points from Spring applications (servlet filter, rest template, scheduled actions, message channels, feign client).
* If `spring-cloud-sleuth-zipkin` is available then the app will generate and report https://zipkin.io[Zipkin]-compatible traces via HTTP. By default it sends them to a Zipkin collector service on localhost (port 9411). Configure the location of the service using `spring.zipkin.baseUrl`.
