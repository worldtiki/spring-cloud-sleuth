== Overview
Spring Cloud Sleuth provides Spring Boot auto-configuration for distributed
tracing. Underneath, Spring Cloud Sleuth is a layer over a Tracer library named
https://github.com/openzipkin/brave[Brave].

Sleuth configures everything you need to get started. This includes where trace
data (spans) are reported to, how many traces to keep (sampling), if remote
fields (baggage) are sent, and which libraries are traced.

We maintain an https://github.com/openzipkin/sleuth-webmvc-example[example app] where two Spring Boot services collaborate on an
HTTP request. Sleuth configures these apps, so that timing of these requests are
recorded into https://zipkin.io[Zipkin], a distributed tracing system. Tracing
UIs visualize latency, such as time in one service vs waiting for other
services.

Here's an example of what it looks like:

The https://github.com/openzipkin/sleuth-webmvc-example[source repository] of this
example includes demonstrations of many things, including WebFlux and messaging.
Most features require only a property or dependency change to work. These
snippets showcase the value of Spring Cloud Sleuth: Through auto-configuration,
Sleuth make getting started with distributed tracing easy!

To keep things simple, the same example is used throughout documentation using
basic HTTP communication.
